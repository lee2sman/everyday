Since the 1990s, many scientists in all disciplines, mentioned the Poietic Generator as a model which may help to rethink the cultural, even ant hropological changing, latent in networks, and especially emphasized the urgency of a redefinition of the notion of authorship. Some of thes e researchers brought in a personal support to attempts to practice large-scale experiments using channels such as broadcast television statio ns, museums, public places, etc. Without listening and support from these institutional broadcasters, very few of these projects have been suc cessful. Handicapped by its transdisciplinary or even undisciplinary nature, and naturally questioning the legitimacy of human organizations to which it is dealing with, the action research on the Poietic Generator has never found any other field to flourish as the Internet itself.
