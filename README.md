# Everyday

This is the home page for my daily code sketches and will likely change sporadically.

These are meant to be sketching with code. I'm using html, css, js and the p5js and jQuery libraries.


## Mini Development Log

1 - 8  
spinny css shapes, grids, gradients  
9  
SEASON - year clock. took a looong 4 hours to figure all out. conic-gradient polyfill.   
10, 11  
turtle + yin yang fight - uses turtle-jquery. drunkwalk/randomwalk.  
12  
all i want for christmas is a ... + a .... +  
13  
merzbox listing + links  
14 - 18   
random colors, homemade sequencers, dice rollers, voice sampler instruments  
19, 20, 21  
almost-rogues. made by scratch. using p5dom. implemented items, monsters, fighting, potions, scrolls, gold, hp, xp. not implemented: correct fighting.  
22  
rotate-like. roguelike code but now rotating. input affects motion.  
23 - 27  
flatgames using my tool. 27 is a prototype flatgame builder.  
28 - 35  
generative or css drawing, gradient, face, y mas. check 32 and 33: flag, and black flag  
36 - 54  
3D projects (of somewhat increasing complexity). check any, but especially later ones like 52/rothkubes.  
55 - 57  
Visited Taipei Museum of Fine Arts - saw Yu Peng's retrospective and used elements from epic 5 Women painting and Mountains of Fu Chun for generative exploratory works with p5play.  
58  
self-playing self-query-scape  
59-61  
floating heads variations, responding to voice, audio  
62  
Paintmaster. instant digital glitch funk backgrounds. click to redraw.  
63  
dungeon map maker - control sprites  
64  
10,000 bowls of oatmeal dungeon zone name generator  
'pair of earrings mall','shoe lace economic zone','incense holder institute','rat mission'  
65  
unfinished ascii block drawing, ultra too simple n bug-ful  
66  
used this as a flux talking head for a promo at ARoS museum in Denmark  
67  
my bald head simulator  
68  
more baldness w/ sound and motion  
69 - 72  
a random white noise player (voice sounds) made for disquiet junto 0398: rauschen bern, 70 = groan sounds, 71 = fm3 buddha machine sounds, 72 = eno music for airports sounds  
73  
"press package"  
74  
a roguelike zoo creator. minimal. needs some work.  
75  
more roguelike dungeon-drawing experiment (+ glitch box maker)  
76  
minimal experiment to make a web-based button builder - 2 modes  
77  
testing...testing...json button object reader  
78 - 80  
These 3 are links to projects I created in November for [National Novel Generating Month](http://nanogenmo.github.io), an annual tradition where computational potes/botmakers/coder-artists produce generated *novels*, defined as being output of 50k words or more. 78 is pomelo, my generator to produce Yoko Ono instruction text pieces in the style of her books Grapefruit and Acorn. This took me a few days, and I used Kate Compton's [Tracery](http://tracery.io) library, and had a few issues getting it going. I still want to pick this back up and tweak it a bit better sometime. The titles don't connect well to the associated generated text. 79 is a link to a Nano-NaNoGenMo (sub 256 character) program I wrote to generate a novel called *Don't Talk to Me or My Son or My Son's Son or My Son's Son's Son Ever Again*. 80 is a link to *Lucifer Bimbisara or Francois unsuperscribed*, another Nano-NaNoGenMo program that uses the built-in word lists on Linux computers to generate poetic text.  
81  
Oh man, I've tried to make [roguelikes](https://roguelike.club/roguelikes.html) with p5.js a bunch, but never got to anything playable. (See earlier experiments 19-22). This is a first minimal playable thing. Still needs a good core mechanic. Visually I had fun with it, making my own [Brough-like](https://itch.io/jam/broughlike). Lots still to do.  
82  
this is a modified version of 81 so that it's self-playing  
83  
oh, what the hell, it's 4am, i built a scanner-camera, inspired by a short [article](https://reading.supply/@joshuajenkins/imitating-a-copier-evmvhD) and photo/gifs from Joshua Jenkins. He didn't share any code, but I thought this was an interesting idea to build a scanner-style camera in p5.js. Mine can scan top to bottom or right to left. There's a bug. Need to play with the image drawing lines to figure out where, probably in the size of the camera capture.  
84  
oh, just some goals  
85  
oh, just some goals-sheet-maker  
86  
a zine-maker! wooo! includes a help screen! it has its own documentation and is being built out. needs to output pdf!  
87  
it's 83, the scan-camera hosted on glitch.com and embedded here so it'll work in other peoples' browsers because it's using https now  
88  
Printster7200, a generative poster-maker! it's modified from 86's code (ZineMaker2054) but now it's a single page poster-maker. should be built into a more robust tool!  
89  
started building out a mini 3d game engine thing instead of using unity. exercise in futility. has a soundtrack, you can eat things. move with arrow keys. grab and rotate world. move mouse to rotate 'body'.  
90  
different version of 89. playable. not a game but a good roamer.  
91  
poster grid. posters generated with printwobbler, new version of 84. saved, presented on screen with version of 83's starter code.  
92  
remake 51 w/ file input option. a demake of the floor of messlife.  
93  
remix of 92, unfortunately now with boxes. need more organic shapes next. i'm on an airplane so couldn't look up syntax. mouse grab rotates.  
94  
variation of 93, using screenshots of terminal / txt / imgs. mouse grab rotates.  
95  
simple 2d bezier curves in 3d space, at first an emulation of struggle inc / cody hudson but mine is much simpler, done in 20-30 min, worth revisiting later. mouse grab to rotate/reposition.  
96  
sucky bad first rendering of ultra dashed off scene made from scans of my notebook chickenscratch and some crayone drawings. don't yet know how to properly render lights in webgl from unity. looked fine in the editor? no skybox. no nothin' really.  
97  
same problems, different day. using images scanned in C.F. from a poster hanging in my bedroom from his show "Comics" exhibited at beginnings in brooklyn circa 2014?  
98  
mockup of a different version of the talking face. won't work in firefox or on http, requires https. copy on glitch.com should work  
99  
modification of 57, self-flying - submission to vector fest  
100  
redo 58, submission to vector fest
101  
blatant oblique strategies cover  
102  
doodle studio 95 mini zone, music from my modular. bizarro. corona virus indoors day. sunday.  
103  
a flatgame using starter movement and animation scripts from the [flatgame first-timer's beginner's guide](https://flatgame.itch.io/first-timers-tutorial). made of drawings of the houses i've lived in, and my notes. music recorded on my modular synth. created in nu jersey.  
104  
my second 2d in 3d game. made with drawings in my notebook of my childhood house at 232 henley. put a lot of time into getting this right, figuring out sound, ending fade/glitches, etc. proud of this one.  
105

this is an attempt at recreating a mid-90s shareware videogame I used to play on Mac system 9. It came on a disk with hundreds of programs on it. I don't remember the name. The graphics and sound were different. This is my take. Images from [Ruins of Desert Cathay](https://archive.org/details/ruinsofdesertcat01stei).  This is a first commit/version, i am continuing to work on it in another location and will publish to my itch page.  
151, 152  
first steps. 151: generating a random "customer" as a first step to possibly building out a generated world, inspired by my microfiction game Shopkeeper. 152: trying to figure out why translate is also rotating, probably due to adding up translations in draw? more investigation needed.
