	<p>ZineMaker2054 is a next-generation zine creation tool to aid in your creative process. ZineMaker automates the creation of your zine's initial page photo layouts, then lets you select which pages you'd like to remix. You can add a title, your name, text background color, change the number of pages, or save your zine to your computer as an image file.</p> 
	
	<h4>After you've loaded your images, click any page to refresh its layout.</h4>

	<p><strong>File Selection</strong> - Click to open the file selection menu. You can select and add a single file or select multiple files at once. They will be added as potential source images for your zine. <em>Each time you add an image ALL of your pages will be scrambled and remixed again using all of your current and previous uploaded images.</em></p>
