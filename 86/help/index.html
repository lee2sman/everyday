	<h3>Note: Click on any page you've scrolled to and it will replace that page with a different layout and selection of images</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>File Selection</strong> - Click to add a single file or select multiple files at once. They will be added as potential source images for your zine and your pages will be scrambled and remixed using these new images.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Color Picker</strong> - This color picker is used to set the background color block behind the zine title and artist name</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Change Title</strong> - Change the default title of the zine. It attempts to scale the size to the title's length, within reason. Deleting the text will reset the name to ZineMaster2054. Want a blank title? Use a space</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Add Artist's Name</strong> - Use this to add a credit line to the front of your zine</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Number of Pages</strong> - Enter a number greater than 0 and less than 255. Each time you change this your zine pages and images will be scrambled and remixed using the new page length.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Print</strong> - Prints out an image file of the entire length of your zine, removing the buttons from the printed version</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><strong>Help</strong> - It got you here.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>ZineMaster2054 is by Lee Tusman. The initial prototype was created in a day during regular code sketch time, though the idea had been floating in my head for years. I'd love to see anything you make. And please send feedback and suggestions to <a href="http://leetusman.com" alt="Lee Tusman">me</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/lee2sman/everyday/tree/master/86" alt="GitHub repo">code</a>.</p>
