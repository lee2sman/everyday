<div id="about">
  <p>homezonez88</p>
<p> is a simulation manifestation of the neighborhood of comrade 186345218 (of sector 88) based on ambient memories and dream-material of their native living units, education centers and public spaces. building on the ambient hypnagogic reconstruction technology of the mid 20XX+, zones- autodeploys com ‘s neural gates in the earliest era of that technology.</p>

<p>although com’s neural matter is ceased, this reconstruction appears to present commune units, sub-dwellings, store houses, street zones, skree zones, and other living units popular around the time between the first and second Great Crisi within northeast midlantic. the home zones appear to demonstrate the latest trends in building of its time, from camuoflage dazzle -spec to smart slime technology at a time when comrades had to rapidly adapt to the chaos of enviro-breakdown and there was a rise in intentional coliving collectives and their need to build environmentally-resistant and adaptive living units.</p>

<p>at this point the original p-wave material sleep systems has not been entirely reconstructed and calibrated. while the software is owned by the museum, the compression codec from that era has not yet been located. in the meantime, please enjoy this series of rendered dwell-units from home zonez88 of comrade 186345218, recovered from a physical storage device when such technology existed, and saved as playable zonez-files. the scanfiles showing an individual are believed to be of comrade 186345218.</p>
