	<b>Description:</b> 
Lorem ipsum is example text you can use as a designer to see how your text will fit on a web page or in a program or in a page of a book for example, named for the latin text often used. There are many easily searchable Lorem Ipsum text generators. Bacon Ipsum, Hipster ipsum are two that immediately come to mind.
<br>
I wanted to make my own bespoke retro and shareware-style software description generator to describe the kinds of things I would have found in a cheap bin at the local computer store in the late 90s (well, maybe not), so I made one with Tracery. The original text (at bottom of the page) was hand-written. The generated text at the top is created through my Tracery <em>grammar</em>.
