	<b>Description:</b> 
	From July 10 - 17, 2023 I participated in the <a href='https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-06-04-old-computer-challenge-v3.html' alt='Old Computer Challenge V3 blog post on Solene's dataswamp'>Old Computer Challenge 2023</a>, an informal week-long event where disparate folks interested in <em>smol</em> computing such as <a href='https://gemini.circumlunar.space/' alt='Project Gemini'>Project Gemini</a>, <a href='https://permacomputing.net/' alt='Permacomputing wiki'>permacomputing</a>, and reducing tech consumption spend a week using old or ancient computing technology as their main machine and report back on their experiences. You can read my <a href='https://leetusman.com/nosebook' alt='Nosebook'>nosebook blog</a> for details. I set up Void Linux running on a Raspberry Pi 1B I had in a shoebox. I purchased the Pi in 2013 as I was first learning to code, and set it up as a retro game machine, then taught a workshop on the topic at The Hacktory in Philadelphia, RIP. I first ran just the command line for a few days, but decided I wanted multi screens and some GUI apps and photos, but that's when things started to slow down considerably. All in all, I had a positive experience getting things to work, trying to take things slow on such a low-powered machine, and I'll be doing some further follow-up tests as I work on some permacomputing archival projects.
