# Self-Doubting System

Self-Doubting System is a zero-player game. It is a self-playing generative work commissioned by MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology for [Generative Unfoldings](https://arts.mit.edu/cast/symposia/generative-unfoldings-call/). Generative Unfoldings is an online exhibition, printed book and symposia in Spring 2021.

Embodying a constellation of artistic practices and generative techniques, the work uses source materials from the artist, collected texts, and quotations embedded with the *fortune* files of an operating systems - a collaboration between artist and software. The narrative is inconclusively self-reflective yet also indicative of a machine's *intelligence* questioning its source of values. 

The work features digital drawings and sketches. The artist combines generative techinques to working with personal input sources rather than 2d primitive shapes. 

*Lee Tusman is a New York-based new media artist and educator. He is interested in how DIY culture translates to the screen and across internet communities. Tusman rejects commercial tools and applications and is buoyed by the digital community of artist-hackers that build, share and collaborate on new tools of creation and collaboration. For this reason, working collaboratively  in learning and making communities are fundamental to my practice.*

### Repeating playthroughs and print output

By default, the program's generative program will produce different playthroughs each time. To get repeated programs simply append a starting seed using the following API: ```?seed=<number>```. 

You can also specify a ```page``` number for output, useful for producing pages of print. *If specified, the program will pause and produce a static image and Save As dialog box.* For example, to specify a seed 90 and page number 5, append ```?seed=90&page=5``` to the end of the URL address.
