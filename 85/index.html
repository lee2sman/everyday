    <!-- took me a day at my parents off and on, drinking puerh on xmas eve day. 
      we went to beddia's pizza for dinner. it was my first time.
      catching a glimpse of my old neighborhood.
      pizza was just okay. ops, round the corner from me in bushwick is better i think.
      but the conversation was good.
      and the soft serve ice cream was incredibly delicious.
      i had a kombucha vermouth drink with lots of ice.
