			<div class="intro">
				<p>Radio Free Aarhus is an experimental audio zine created by Lee Tusman for Flux Factory's Residency at ARoS Art Museum in Aarhus Denmark, Summer 2022. All recordings were captured on an Olympus Pearlcorder L150 Microcassette Recorder purchased at a swap meet in Berlin in July 2022. In one of its initial test recordings, composer/instrument builder Daniel Fishkin aimed to demonstrate how one could create a vibrato effect just by shaking a microcassette recorder, instantly permanently altering the playback speed of the recording device.</p>

				<p>Recordings were made at locations including ARoS museum, on the lawn before Book1 hostel late at night, at Institute for (X), at an apartment dinner party, and at a Turkish restaurant in Gallerup. Our approach to recording is one of eager sampling and experimentation, allowing spaces to create sound and for sound to create space. This space is a manifestation of Flux Factory in its own time and space.</p>

				<p>Here the fragments and juxtapositions become part of the texture pallete. This is far from a perfect digital recording. The tiny handheld recorder can be played like an instrument itself, and it imposes its own speed, distortions, fuzzes, glitches.</p>
