# Games I'd like to play and/or make

- [ ] a command line text-game where you wander between different villages with a donkey. You are trying to buy ~~silks~~ textiles. Like Dopewars? When you are successful, you return home to a feast. High chance of failure.
- [ ] a hand drawn black and white (charcoal? pencil?) and scanned in assets. You ar ewandering around a bombed-out post-apocalyptic landscape, but plants are taking back over (kudzu?). Ther aer old broken bits of technology, like old keyboards and ethernet cables that you can find occasionally. At some point you find a gameboy and turn it on. It still works and you can play little games on it.
- [ ] A game where you have to fill out generated grants and artists statements with your wildest ideas. Each form and RPF is different. But when you submit, there is some chance your grant will be *accepted* (maybe it depends on number of questions what your chances are?). Fireworks shoot off when one of your grants is accepted and your score increases by one.
- [ ] A game where you are pushing a katamari ball and you roll up and remove cars from the street. Eventually you are big enough to roll up McMansions, police departments, prisons, corporations.
- [ ] a videogame where you read a book
- [ ] a videogame at the north (south?) pole. Made up of generated pokey the penguin characters and dialog and quests that don't need to be done.

- [ ] a game like rock band except that it's a jazz quartet playing a simple 1-4-5 blues progression and you're playing keyboard accompaniment while NPCs take turns soloing. you have a midi keyboard controller and nothing bad happens if you hit off notes other than it may sound bad to you. it should have a bunch of fake book songs to choose from, slow blues, and the sounds of glasses clinking and clapping after solos.
- [ ] a game where you collect snipped out letters and then compose a ransom note. it tells you who the ransom note should be written for.

- [ ] a game where you design or select a simple flag, motto, food, drink, flower favored in each village and then see how civilization plays out and cultures combine and influence each other
- [ ] a game where you collect and read library books. there should be a large number of books (from project gutenberg?) and nooks to read in. actually, maybe the virtual nook should drop away and the while the character reads the book on the screen you should mostly just have the ebook available for you to read in your own real nook somewheres
