			QuiltSoft Designer is a black and white (or green and black on QB Systems
			Machines) ASCII quilt design program. This entirely command line software
			renders quilt patterns in graphical ASCII text output and produces
			procedurally generated quilt patterns. A special miniature music haiku
			tracker program creates an 8bit audio ditty to complement each visual
			quilt design. In Town Mode, a 2d ASCII town is procedurally rendered and
			the user can traverse the town, visiting various inhabitants and their
			quilts within the rendered environment. These quilts and songs can be
			collected and stored for later retrieval.

			Pachinko Parlor is a low stakes pinball-like video game featuring minimal
			graphics and sound effects. Pachinko machine gameplay consists of a player
			loading and releasing a set number of balls at the top of a playing field,
			then watching them drop, bounce and land or miss target cups. The Pachinko
			Parlor software is capable of producing an infinite variety of pachinko
			machine variations of pins, cups, bumpers and tracks. There is also a
			popular Pachinko Builder mode where players can become designers,
			selecting colors, hardware options and sound effects. Pachinko machines
			created with Pachinko Builder mode can be named and saved and distributed
			via disk. Pachinko Parlor is distributed on floppy disk. No manual or
			instructions are included.

			Flag 2) Surrender 3) Quit. Creating a flag generates a plain white flag
			design. Option 2 creates an animation of a waving white flag using the
			design saved from option 1. Option 3 exits the program.
