	<b>Description:</b> 
	This started as a draft prototype for <a href='https://taper.badquar.to/10/about.html' alt='Taper'>Taper issue 11</a>. Taper is a web-based journal for computational poetry and literary art, with the caveat that the code for your work must fit within 2kilobytes. I had this idea to design a game-like infinite driving sim in ASCII text. I still need to code golf i.e. reduce the code size to fit their requirement. I wanted to add additional features including web audio, obstactles and more color transitions that won't fit. While appearing extremely simple, I learned a bit making this.
