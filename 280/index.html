	<b>Descrip:</b> Created as a part of the  <a href='https://html.energy/events.html' alt='HTML Energy events page'>HTML Energy</a> freewrite in NYC June 3, 2023 from 6:30pm-7:30pm, held in Valentino Park in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The images are of the blustery beautiful day pre-sunset, with a group of people concentrating, sitting in the grass, writing and programming by the river and warehouses. I took photographs with the BitCam camera and then wrote the code with pen in a traveler's notebook before transcribing it in vim on the phone, connected to the server. This is the post-event cleaned up version.
