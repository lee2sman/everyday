# p5.roguelike

Hi, this is a starter attempt at building a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game using [p5.js](http://p5js.org) and Javascript.

This isn't robust or necessarily even best practices. Heck, it's barely a game. I'm coding it from scratch.

The goal is for this to serve as starter code for the future creation of more roguelikes in p5. The p5js libraries p5sound and p5js are linked in the index.html page.

All code in sketch.js.

Design inspiration from [Michael Brough](http://www.smestorp.com/).

All images drawn/generated by me using my [Paintmaster 5054](http://leetusman.com/everyday/62/).

## Goal

Descend as many levels as possible. Can you get past 9?

## Controls

Arrow keys / Vimkeys / WASD for movement.
. (period) to wait. (Enemies move but you stay still for the move)

`>` or ENTER or RETURN or SPACE to descend (on stairs)


'?' brings up the About / Help page  
'r' resets the game  
'm' mute/toggles audio on and off
