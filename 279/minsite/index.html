    <h1>Adventures in minimal styling</h1>
    <p>This text appears to be a minimal and boring <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext' alt='wikipedia article on plaintext'>plaintext</a> website. Fine. But it is also a way to test out various 'minimal' style schema.</p>
    <blockquote>This would be a quote someone once said. A Blockquote, if you will.</blockquote>
    <p>
      I am doing this because I want to have a minimal, attractive, eminently readable site that would still attract an audience, can be scanned, and be (as much as possible) resilient to the brittleness of the web browser. 
    </p>
    <h2>What about images?</h2>
    <p>We have them. Here's a dithered low resolution image of a book, sharing a design sensibility with this webpage design and a goal of enabling longterm archiving. When we're talking about considering longterm preservation then websites and books can and should go hand in hand!</p>

    <h3>Experiments in lower resolutions</h>
      <p>Okay, but why the low resolution? This can also be considered a form af accessibility as a lower resolution may mean lower file size which means this can be downloaded quicker, use less bandwdith and compute resources, and thus is more accessible for a wider community on slower connections and a rebuke too the high-intensity web apps and frameworks of today.</p>

  </figure> 



  <h3>Now black and white</h3>
  <p>I left the size of this one a bit larger to test how the different stylesheets will handle it<p>
  <p>For the <a href='https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/' alt='Low Power Website'>Low Tech Website</a> they discuss how the low res image helps clue the viewer into something different going on. This may be a reason to pursue this approach, since the new (and Google-initiated?) webp format is a lower filesize than the jpeg lossy filesize for example, thus potentially removing some of the size goals of creating a lower consumption/bandwidth website</p>

    <h3>Stylesheets I am evaluating</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My own timetable stylesheet, under development</li>
      <li><a href='http://www.cblgh.org'>Cblgh's</a> default stylesheet, with <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html'>XXIIVV</a> styling and resetting defaults.</li>
      <li>My own attempt at cloning the style of buttondown pages</li>
      <li>A modified version by Cblgh used for the cerca forum</li>
      <li>A more minimal stylesheet by Max on their <a href='https://interviews.commoninternet.net/'>Common Internet Interviews</a> minisite</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advantages of a minimal style</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Resist brittleness of changing styles and standards</li>
      <li>Less to debug</li>
      <li>Easier for humans and robots to scan</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Considerations</h2>

    <p>
    <em>Ideally</em> I use and create open source styles that are still <strong>attractive</strong> to an audience who doesn't care about any of these above concerns but will gain the advantages nonetheless!</p>
    <p>One last consideration. Does this work well on phones? Try it and see.</p>

    <footer>
      <p>A footer should go here. Banner images? <a href='https://www.gamemaking.tools/' alt='GameMaking Tools wiki'><img src='https://www.gamemaking.tools/images/banner_v3.gif' alt='GameMaking Tools wiki'></a> </p>
